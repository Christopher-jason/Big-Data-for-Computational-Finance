    "The purpose of this lab session is to introduce you to the main optimisation notions and let you build your first optimisation programs. Recall that in the last lecture we discussed an example with a brewery that produced two types of beel, ale and lager, and our goal was to decide, given the available ingredients and the profit margin, how many barrels to produce (and whether these are ale or lager) "

Each barel of ale returns a profit of £13, while each barel of lager returns a profit of £23. Finally, our ingredients are restricted in quantity.

    "Recall what was our first step. We turned the **constraints** into equations involving **variables**. In particular, we used $A$ to denote the number of barrels of ale and $B$ denote the number of barrels of lager. Remember: our goal is to maximise our profit. This gave rise to the equations below. The top line is our **objective function** while the remaining lines correspond to **constraints**. The entire *program* is what we call a **linear program**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both the objective function and all constraints are *linear*, that is, each variable ($A$ or $B$) appear with an exponent of $1$. For example, the objective function $\\max_{A,B}{13A^2+23B}$ would not be linear ($A$ is raised to the power of $2$), while a constraint such as $A\\cdot B\\leq 100$ would not be linear as the term $A\\cdot B$ involves multiplying two variables and is, hence, raised again to a power other than $1$.\n",

    "If you attended Lecture 2, you might remember that the **optimal** solution was to produce 12 barrels of ale and 28 barrels of lager, giving a profit of £800. I demonstrated why this is the optimal solution, by arguing about the **space of feasible solutions**, that is, about the possible solutions that satisfy all constraints, and then I explained why the solution $(A=12, B=28)$ is the best.\n",
