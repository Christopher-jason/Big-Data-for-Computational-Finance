    "### 3b. Gurobi and Gurobipy\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi is a powerful optimisation software. It is installed in the lab computers and we covered an example in the most recent lecture on how to use it. In case you wish to check it now, please visit slides 71 to 81 in file *CF969 - 3 - Mathematical Optimisation.pptx* in the CF969 moodle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from using Gurobi on its own, we have the option to invoke Gurobi through Python, by using the *gurobipy* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Gurobipy\n",
    "\n",
    "To install gurobipy, please see https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-\n",
    "\n",
    "If your are using Horizon (https://csee-horizon.essex.ac.uk/portal/webclient/index.html), please open a command prompt and execute (while still in drive m:\\) \"m:\\python -m pip install gurobipy\" (without the quotes)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solving an Integer Linear Program with Gurobipy\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to use gurobipy to solve an integer linear program. Recall that in integer linear programs, each variable must be given an integer value. Such constraints arise quite naturally in many different settings.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Task Assignment Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider three tasks that need to be completed: let's call them A, B, and C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider three users that, in principle, can do the tasks: 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to perform each task is as follows: User 1 can execute task A with quality 0.53, task B with quality 0.27 and task C with quality 0.13. Similarly, user 2 has 0.8 for task A, 0.47 for task B, and 0.67 for task C, and finally, user 3 has 0.53 for task A, 0.73 for task B, and 0.47 for task C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption**: Only one user can be assigned to a task, and each user must execute at most one task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine an assignment that ensures that each task is executed and each user executes at most one tasks in order to maximize the total quality of the tasks executed according to the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variable $x_{r,\\; j} = 1$ represents that user r is assigned to task j, and 0 otherwise, for  r=1,2,3 and 𝑗=1,2,3.\n",
